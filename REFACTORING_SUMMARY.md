## Next Steps

The refactoring plan is ongoing, with the following tasks still pending:

1. **Testing Enhancement and Coverage Improvement**:

   - **Current testing**: 400+ tests running successfully
   - **Current coverage**: 61% (as reported by Codecov)
   - **Target coverage**: 85-90%
   - **Coverage analysis findings**:
     - **Zero coverage modules**: Several critical modules have 0% coverage, including:
       - Legacy pipeline implementation (`src/llm_rag/rag/pipeline.py`)
       - Legacy document loaders (`src/llm_rag/document_processing/loaders.py`)
       - Most anti-hallucination framework modules
       - Pipeline factory module
     - **Low coverage modules**: Key modules with under 50% coverage:
       - Main anti-hallucination interface (19%)
       - Conversational pipeline (27%)
       - Multimodal vector store (41%)
       - PDF loaders (44%)
       - Base pipeline classes (48%)
   - **Current challenges**:
     - Uneven test distribution, with many modules having minimal or no coverage
     - Limited testing of error conditions and edge cases
     - Some test redundancy in well-covered modules
     - Inconsistent mocking strategies
   - **Quality-Focused Strategy**:
     - Focus on critical areas with 0-20% coverage first
     - Prioritize testing error handling branches
     - Cover edge cases (empty inputs, unexpected file formats)
     - Test integration points between components
     - Focus on test quality over quantity (100% coverage doesn't guarantee bug-free code)
   - **Refactoring for Testability**:
     - Extract pure functions from complex methods
     - Create clearer interfaces between components
     - Apply dependency injection patterns to make mocking easier
   - **Test Efficiency Improvements**:
     - Use parameterized tests to cover multiple scenarios without duplicating code
     - Implement proper test fixtures and setup/teardown
     - Organize tests by execution speed (unit â†’ integration â†’ e2e)
     - Configure test parallelization with pytest-xdist for faster execution
   - **Test Suite Organization**:
     - Group tests by category and run faster tests locally
     - Set up longer tests to run only in CI or on scheduled intervals
     - Split test suite in CI into multiple jobs for faster feedback
     - Review and consolidate redundant tests

2. **Documentation**:

   - Update API documentation
   - Add architecture diagrams
   - Create usage examples
   - Include coverage badges and metrics

3. **Script Organization Completion**:
   - Continue testing and fixing scripts in their new locations
   - Update import paths where needed
   - Create a proper quarantine/legacy folder for deprecated code
   - Update documentation to reference script locations correctly

The current refactoring follows the planned approach of maintaining backward compatibility while gradually improving the codebase's structure and test coverage, both critical factors for the ongoing stability and maintainability of the system.

### Code Coverage Improvement Timeline

- **Immediate (2 weeks)**: Reach 70% coverage by focusing on core pipeline components
- **Short-term (1 month)**: Reach 80% coverage by improving anti-hallucination and document processing tests
- **Medium-term (2 months)**: Reach 85%+ coverage by addressing remaining gaps
- **Long-term (3 months)**: Stabilize at 90% coverage with comprehensive test suite

This timeline aligns with our overall goal of creating a highly maintainable, well-tested codebase that adheres to clean code principles and SOLID design.
