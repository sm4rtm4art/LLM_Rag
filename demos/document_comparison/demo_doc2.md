# Sample Document 2

## Introduction

This is the second sample document for testing the document comparison module. It contains similar content as the first document but with some modifications.

## Feature Overview

The document comparison module can:

- Parse structured documents
- Align corresponding sections
- Compare sections using embeddings
- Generate readable diffs
- Handle different document formats

## Implementation Details

The implementation uses several key components:

1. Document parser for segmenting documents
2. Section aligner for matching corresponding sections
3. Comparison engine for calculating similarities
4. Diff formatter for generating reports

### Document Parser

The document parser converts structured documents into logical sections based on headings, paragraphs, lists, and other structural elements.

### Section Aligner

The section aligner matches corresponding sections between two documents using strategies like heading matching and content similarity analysis.

### Embedding Comparison

This is a new section that wasn't in the first document. It explains how the embedding comparison works to determine similarities between sections.

## Conclusion

This modified demo shows how the document comparison module detects various types of changes.
