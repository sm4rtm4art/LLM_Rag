# Sample Document 1

## Introduction

This is the first sample document for testing the document comparison module. It contains multiple sections with different types of content.

## Feature Overview

The document comparison module can:

- Parse structured documents
- Align corresponding sections
- Compare sections using embeddings
- Generate readable diffs

## Implementation Details

The implementation uses several components:

1. Document parser for segmenting documents
2. Section aligner for matching corresponding sections
3. Comparison engine for calculating similarities
4. Diff formatter for generating reports

### Document Parser

The document parser converts structured documents into logical sections based on headings, paragraphs, lists, and other elements.

### Section Aligner

The section aligner matches corresponding sections between two documents using strategies like heading matching and content similarity.

## Conclusion

This demo shows how the document comparison module works in practice.
