# LLM-RAG Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the incremental refactoring plan for the LLM-RAG codebase, focusing on maintainability, SOLID principles, and clean code practices while ensuring that the original functionality is preserved at each step.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Keep Original Files Intact**: Maintain the original files as long as possible to preserve backward compatibility
2. **Incremental Changes**: Make small, testable changes rather than large-scale rewrites
3. **SOLID Principles**: Apply Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion
4. **Clean Code Practices**: Ensure code is readable, well-documented, and properly tested
5. **Design Patterns**: Use appropriate patterns where they add value without over-engineering

## Phase 1: Centralized Cross-Cutting Concerns (Completed)

- âœ… Created centralized logging system (`src/llm_rag/utils/logging.py`)
- âœ… Implemented standardized error handling (`src/llm_rag/utils/errors.py`)

## Phase 6B: Test Strategy

To address the low test coverage (~26%) and ensure reliable, maintainable code, we'll implement a comprehensive testing strategy:

### Testing Approach

1. **Multi-Level Testing**:

   - Unit Tests: Test individual components in isolation
   - Integration Tests: Test interactions between components
   - End-to-End Tests: Test the entire pipeline with real-world scenarios

2. **TDD for New Components**:

   - Write tests before implementing new features
   - Use tests to validate requirements are met
   - Refactor with confidence once tests pass

3. **Targeted Coverage Improvement**:
   - Focus first on critical path components
   - Prioritize code with complex logic
   - Cover error handling and edge cases

### Component Test Priorities

1. **Core Pipeline (Highest Priority)**:

   - RAGPipeline and ConversationalRAGPipeline classes
   - Document retrieval mechanisms
   - Context formatting logic
   - LLM integration points

2. **Document Processing (High Priority)**:

   - Loaders for different document types
   - Chunking and splitting algorithms
   - Metadata extraction and handling

3. **Anti-Hallucination (Medium-High Priority)**:

   - Entity verification mechanisms
   - Similarity checking algorithms
   - Response post-processing

4. **Vector Stores and Models (Medium Priority)**:

   - Vector store integration
   - Model factory and different backends
   - Embedding generation and handling

5. **Utilities and Configuration (Medium-Low Priority)**:
   - Logging mechanisms
   - Configuration handling
   - Error types and propagation

### Coverage Targets

- **Short-term (1 day)**: Increase overall coverage to 50%

  - Focus on core pipeline and document processing
  - Fix test collection issues

- **Medium-term (2 days)**: Increase overall coverage to 65%

  - Add tests for anti-hallucination
  - Cover vector stores and models

- **Long-term (1 week)**: Increase overall coverage to 80%+
  - Complete edge case testing
  - Add performance and stress tests
  - Implement property-based testing for complex algorithms

### Implementation Plan

1. **Immediate Actions**:

   - Fix test collection errors in document processing tests
   - Create fixtures and mock objects for common testing scenarios
   - Implement basic coverage for untested components

2. **Week 1**:

   - Focus on RAGPipeline and core functionality
   - Add tests for document loaders and processors
   - Fix failing tests from architectural changes

3. **Week 1.5**:

   - Add tests for anti-hallucination components
   - Implement vector store and model factory tests
   - Create more end-to-end test scenarios

4. **Ongoing**:
   - Monitor coverage metrics
   - Add tests for new features as they're developed
   - Refine existing tests to cover edge cases

### Testing Tools and Techniques

- **Framework**: pytest with pytest-cov for coverage analysis
- **Mocking**: unittest.mock for isolating components
- **Fixtures**: Common test data, configurations, and mock objects
- **Parameterization**: Test multiple scenarios efficiently
- **Property-Based Testing**: Hypothesis for complex algorithms
- **CI Integration**: Run tests on each commit, enforce coverage thresholds

This strategy will ensure systematic improvement of test coverage while prioritizing the most critical components of the system.

## Phase 7: Deprecation Strategy

- Only after thorough testing and validation:
  - [ ] Mark original monolithic implementations as deprecated
  - [ ] Add warnings for direct usage of deprecated components
  - [ ] Update all examples to use new structure
  - [ ] Provide migration guidance for users

## Implementation Approach

Throughout this refactoring, we will:

1. **Keep Tests Running**: Ensure all tests pass after each change
2. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**: Keep the original interfaces working
3. **Apply Changes Incrementally**: Make small, focused changes rather than big rewrites
4. **Follow SOLID Principles**: Ensure each module has a single responsibility
5. **Document Changes**: Keep documentation in sync with code changes

The goal is to improve the codebase's maintainability and extensibility while ensuring it remains fully functional throughout the process.
